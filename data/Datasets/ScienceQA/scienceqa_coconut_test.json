    "question": "Which of the following could Gordon's test show? Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. Choices are: if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour, how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour, whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. Choices are: how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour, if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour, whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour",

Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey. Choices are: echinoderm, cnidarian",

At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.\nThe captain of the Isleifur II first thought the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. But as the Isleifur II approached the column of smoke, the captain and crew saw glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat. It was a volcano erupting under the water!\nFigure: the erupting undersea volcano seen by the sailors on the Isleifur II.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nIvan, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Ivan thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water. Choices are: how much athletes would sweat in the fabric, how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water, if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second",

    "question": "Which of the following could Ernest's test show? Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. Choices are: whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour, how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour, if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMitchell, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Mitchell thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.

    "question": "Which term matches the picture? Hint: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones. Choices are: operant conditioning, classical conditioning",

    "question": "Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago? Hint: Read the text about cats.\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous! Choices are: The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses., The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers., The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice., The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.",

    "question": "Which of the following statements is true? Hint: A substance's physical and chemical properties are all determined by its chemical structure. Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged.\nOne property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor.\nSyrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones.\nSubstances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both.\nOne example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory. Choices are: A flavorant might be both found in nature and made in a chemical factory., A substance's chemical structure depends only on the number and types of atoms in each molecule of the substance.",

    "question": "Which of the following could Sebastian's test show? Hint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

Then answer the question.\n\nAlpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.\nA shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow.\nFigure: a goby and an alpheid shrimp at the entrance of a burrow. Choices are: commensal, parasitic, mutualistic",

    "question": "When might a giant tortoise sleep for weeks at a time? Hint: Read the text about giant tortoises.\nThe Galápagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean are home to the giant tortoise. These tortoises are massive, weighing nearly five hundred pounds. However, giant tortoises do not use much energy.\nThey often rest for up to sixteen hours a day. And when there is little water, giant tortoises might sleep for weeks at a time. This helps them save energy. Giant tortoises can live up to a year without food or water if they have to!\nLife has not always been easy for giant tortoises, though. When people first arrived at the Galápagos Islands hundreds of years ago, they took many of the tortoises away. And some people hunted the tortoises for food and oil. Few tortoises are left on the island today. Luckily, many groups of people are now working to keep these giant animals safe. Hopefully, giant tortoises can roam the islands for many years to come. Choices are: when there is not much water, when the tortoise is growing quickly, when it is cold outside",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.

    "question": "Based on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals? Hint: Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do. Choices are: They can communicate with many kinds of animals., They can communicate about specific problems., They can understand some human speech.",

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nSasha cut tomato and broccoli plant leaves into one-inch squares. In each of 12 containers, she placed six leaf squares: three tomato-leaf squares and three broccoli-leaf squares. She put one slug from her garden into each container. After two days, Sasha measured the amount of each leaf square that had been eaten by the slugs. She compared the amount that had been eaten from the tomato-leaf squares to the amount that had been eaten from the broccoli-leaf squares.\nFigure: a slug on a leaf. Choices are: Do slugs weigh more after eating tomato leaves or broccoli leaves?, Do slugs eat more from tomato leaves or broccoli leaves?",

    "question": "Which term matches the picture? Hint: Read the text.\nFiltration and centrifugation are two techniques used to separate different materials from a mixture. Filtration involves straining unwanted materials, sometimes with the help of gravity. For example, you can pour a liquid mixture through a funnel lined with filter paper that collects unwanted solids.\nCentrifugation, on the other hand, uses centrifugal force to separate materials. For example, vials of mixtures can be placed at an angle in special machines that spin at high speed. The spinning causes denser substances to move and collect at the bottom of the vial. Choices are: filtration, centrifugation",

She wondered how much bacteria might be growing in her cup of tea as the morning went on.\nTo find out, Valentina filled three identical cups with tea and placed them on her desk for three hours. After the first hour, she placed a drop of the tea from each cup on a separate microscope slide and counted the number of bacteria in the drop. Valentina repeated this with each cup of tea after the second hour, and again after the third hour.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

For example, the tissue on the inside of the mouth, called epithelium (ep-i-THEEL-i-um), is protected by a tough layer made of many types of keratin proteins connected together. One type of keratin protein is encoded by the KRT13 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the KRT13 gene. Compared to the KRT13 gene without a mutation, the mutated KRT13 gene encoded a form of the keratin protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the keratin protein could not connect to other keratin proteins.The person with the mutation had mouth epithelium that was easily damaged by simple activities like eating and brushing teeth.\nFigure: strands of connected keratin proteins, seen through a high-powered microscope.
