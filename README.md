# 🥥 Multimodal Coconut: Latent Reasoning with GPT-2 + CLIP on A-OKVQA

This repository contains an implementation of a **Coconut-style latent reasoning framework** that trains a multimodal model combining **GPT-2** (text) and **CLIP** (vision) on the **A-OKVQA** dataset. The model is trained in **curriculum stages** by injecting "latent thought" tokens into the reasoning process.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Latent token reasoning** stages via curriculum learning
- 🧠 **Multimodal** input support: text + image (via CLIP)
- ⚡️ Mixed precision training with **AMP (fp16)** for faster training
- 🎮 GPT-2 as the backbone causal LM with latent token injection
- 🔁 Resume training from any saved epoch checkpoint
- 📈 Integrated with **Weights & Biases (wandb)** for experiment tracking
- 🧰 Modular and readable PyTorch code

## 🧪 Dataset Format

Each `.json` file should be a list of dicts like:

```json
{
  "image": "path/to/image.jpg",
  "question": "What is shown in the image? The choices are 0: cat, 1: dog, 2: horse",
  "steps": ["The animal has pointy ears.", "It is commonly kept as a pet."],
  "answer": "0"
}
````

Ensure `"answer"` is string-formatted (e.g., `"0"` not `0`) for tokenizer compatibility.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multimodal-Coconut-GPT2-CLIP.git
cd Multimodal-Coconut-GPT2-CLIP

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Login to Weights & Biases (optional but recommended)
wandb login
```

---

## 🏃 Training

To start training on **A-OKVQA**, run:

```bash
python run.py args/aokvqa.yaml
```

If resuming from checkpoint (e.g., epoch 10), modify your `aokvqa.yaml`:

```yaml
resume: 10
```

---

## 🧠 Model

This trains a **Coconut-style GPT-2 + CLIP hybrid** that:

* Takes image features from CLIP
* Injects them into GPT-2’s first token embedding
* Inserts a variable number of `<|latent|>` tokens
* Learns to fill in those tokens with latent steps
* Finally generates the answer

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure your image paths in the JSON are valid.
* All training is designed to run on multi-GPU (e.g., Kaggle 2×T4 or Colab Pro+).
* Automatically saves checkpoints every epoch.
* Resume training by editing `resume:` value in `.yaml`.
