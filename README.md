# 🥥 Multimodal Latent Reasoning with GPT-2 + CLIP (Coconut-style)

This project implements a Coconut-style latent reasoning framework combining **GPT-2** (for text) and **CLIP** (for vision) to solve multimodal question answering tasks like **A-OKVQA**. It supports training with **latent tokens**, curriculum learning, and stage-wise reasoning injection.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Inspired by Meta's **Coconut** paper, this project injects latent "thought" tokens between question and answer to simulate intermediate reasoning steps. It integrates:
- **GPT-2** as the language model,
- **CLIP** as the vision encoder,
- Custom logic for staged reasoning over multiple epochs.

---

## 🧠 What Are We Training?

We are training a **multimodal latent reasoning model** to:
- Take **textual questions** and corresponding **images**,
- Insert stage-wise **latent reasoning steps** (via `<|latent|>` tokens),
- Predict the **correct answer** based on reasoning and visual context.

## 📁 Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `run.py` | Entry point to train the model. Handles config parsing, checkpointing, W&B logging, curriculum training, and mixed precision AMP. |
| `coconut.py` | Implements the custom `Coconut` model class. Wraps GPT-2 + CLIP and handles stage-wise latent token reasoning and image embedding injection. |
| `dataset.py` | Dataset and dataloader logic. Loads `.json` files, encodes latent tokens, and handles stage-wise reasoning logic with padding and attention. |
| `args/aokvqa.yaml` | YAML configuration for training on A-OKVQA with curriculum learning and W&B tracking. |

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure to install the following:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets wandb
````

Or use the environment available on **Kaggle / Colab / your own virtualenv**.

---

## 📚 Dataset Format (A-OKVQA)

Each sample in `aokvqa_train.json` follows this schema:

```json
{
  "image": "path/to/image.jpg",
  "question": "What is the man doing? The choices are 0 : sleeping, 1 : running, 2 : eating",
  "steps": ["The man is lying on a bed", "He looks relaxed"],
  "answer": "0"
}
```

You should provide both:

* `aokvqa_train.json`
* `aokvqa_validation.json`

---

## 🏁 Training Instructions

To start training:

```bash
python run.py args/aokvqa.yaml
```

This supports:

* Resuming from checkpoints
* Logging to W\&B
* Mixed precision (fp16) with AMP
* Curriculum learning via `epochs_per_stage`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (`args/aokvqa.yaml`)

```yaml
name: coconut_aokvqa_gunadeep
model_id: gpt2
project: coconut_aokvqa_guna
resume: 0
train_path: /path/to/aokvqa_train.json
val_path: /path/to/aokvqa_validation.json
coconut: true
num_epochs: 25
batch_size_training: 3
c_thought: 2
max_latent_stage: 8
epochs_per_stage: 2
lr: 5e-5
save_path: checkpoints
```

> To resume from a checkpoint (e.g., `checkpoint_10.pt`), just set:
>
> ```yaml
> resume: 10
> ```

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Inference

Evaluation loop is not included yet, but can be integrated similarly to training using `.generate()` in `coconut.py`.

---

## 📈 Logging with Weights & Biases

Track training progress via [W\&B dashboard](https://wandb.ai/gunadeep2005-pes-university/coconut_aokvqa_guna).

```bash
wandb login
```

---

## 🧊 Checkpoints & Resuming

All model checkpoints are saved under:

```
checkpoints/coconut_aokvqa_gunadeep/checkpoint_{epoch}.pt
```

To resume training:

```bash
# Set this in your yaml:
resume: 10
```

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Evaluation & accuracy metrics
* Support for other vision models (e.g. DINOv2)
* Integration with Hugging Face `Trainer`
* Inference demo notebook
